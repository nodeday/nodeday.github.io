                    <h3>We are about Node in Enterprise</h3>

                    <p>
                      NodeDay is by the enterprise, for the enterprise. The purpose of this one day industry conference
                      is to tackle critical issues head on. NodeDay brings people together from companies that have
                      adopted, or are hoping to adopt Node.js, and focus on the issues these organisations have when
                      doing so. It allows them to discuss and share their experiences with Node.js, and offer advice,
                      tips and tricks, and drive forward both the technology and the community. So, come join us on
                      April 27th, 2015 at the No. 1 World Trade Centre as we take on the topics around Node.js that
                      are prevalent in enterprise today.

                            <b>About Edward</b> I've spent over 13 years building large-scale Java based web applications and I'm always seeking new challenges. I've tried to find the right balance of technology and leadership that gives me opportunities to build great teams and great technology. I've spent the last 4 years at TheLadders building teams from 3 to 14 people and helping guide the creation of a great technology organization.
                          I get as excited about a cool product initiative as I do about an innovative tech solution and I'm always looking to continue to grow my skills and knowledge as I continually search for a better way to do everything I do. I love building an amazing team and seeing them succeed.
                          I believe that technology is a driver of the business, not just a service group, and that great developers thrive when they are made a part of the entire product development process resulting in a better chance of success for the business. That belief is core to the way I hire, grow my people, and grow the organization.
